# React Example Applications

This is my collection of small React applications used in my learning process with React.

The course I followed to make these projects can be found here: [React Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

Notes I made for React along the way can also be seen in my [web dev notes repo](https://github.com/paul7dxb/Obsidian-Web-Dev/tree/main/React.js)

## Topics include:
- States & Components
- Hooks including building custom hooks
- Forms & handling user input
- Context
- Redux
- Local storage options without Redux
- Using API calls to make GET/PUT requests to Firebase / MongoDB
- React Router for SPA
- NextJS Basics
- Authentication
- Animations with ReactTransitionGroup
- Testing your code
- Using TypeScript with React

## Example Applications:

- Shopping cart frontend using state
- Sending shopping order to backend
- Get and display items from a backend DB (movie info)
- Meetup app where user can create and view meetups from a DB using API calls


## Security

- Many of the packages / libraries used in these example applications are or will become outdated as time goes by. This can lead to vulnerable applications if deployed.
- It is recommended to update to use the latest versions to minimise the security risk.
- Outdated components were number 6 on the [OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
