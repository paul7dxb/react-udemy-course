# React Example Applications

This is my collection of small React applications used in my learning process with React.

The course I followed to make these projects can be found here: [React Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

Notes I made for React along the way can also be seen in my [web dev notes repo](https://github.com/paul7dxb/Obsidian-Web-Dev/tree/main/React.js)

## Topics include:
- States & Components
- Hooks including custom hooks
- Forms & handling user input
- Redux
- Using API calls to make GET/PUT requests to Firebase
- React Router for SPA

## Example Applications:

- Shopping cart frontend using state
- Sending shopping order to backend
- Get and display items from a backend DB (movie info)
